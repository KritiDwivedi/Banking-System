This is the preview of the website I made.On the front page as it can be seen there are three buttons :

1. Create a user :
This will create an account for a new user.After the account is made the user can now make transactions.

2. Make a transaction :
On clicking this button the user can send or receive money in his or hewr account. The respective details will be modified representing balance deduction or balance increment depending upon whether the user transferred the money or received the money.
